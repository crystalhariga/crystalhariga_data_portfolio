## About Me


## Projects
#### 1. [Let's Catch Them Stronger Pokemon!](https://github.com/crystalhariga/pokemon)
* Charts visualizing which Pokemon Type is the strongest, you guessed it: it's __Dragon__!
* Logistic Regression Model to determine whether a Pokemon is Legendary for Pokemon Trainers
  * To prevent wastage of Master PokeBalls

<br/>
*Keywords*: Data Visualization, Missing Data, Imbalanced Data, Logistic Regression
*Tools*: Python (pandas, numpy, seaborn, matplotlib, sklearn)

<br/>

#### 2. [Movie Catalog Database Design](https://github.com/crystalhariga/movie-catalog)
* Designed a data dictionary from 4 datasets for ease of accessibility to display movie information onto Movie Catalog web app using Python
* Designed a search algorithm (filtering), by checking whether the search query matches the movie information available (still needs improvement)
* Designed the front-end of web app using Dash: incorporating interactive buttons to search through database, displaying movie information and poster images

#### [Predicting Cancer Cases in the US](https://github.com/crystalhariga/cancer_ml)
* Performed data preparation (transformed variables, clustering) and EDA (descriptive statistics, simple visualization) to understand more about the dataset
* Built Prediction (Regression Tree, Linear Regression) and Classification (KNN, Logistic Regression, Boosted Tree, Bagged Tree) models to predict annual cancer cases
* Compared best hand-crafted models with DataRobot's -- resulting in:
    * __Best Classification Model__: Hand-crafted Bagging Tree with 0.93 Accuracy score (_successfully beat DataRobot!_)
    * __Best Prediction Model__: DataRobot's Random Forest Regressor with RMSE of 418.02
