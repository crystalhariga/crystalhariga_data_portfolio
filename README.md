# Data Analytics Portfolio

## About Me
Graduated with a Psychology degree, I love to understand people. 
I pursued the path of Market Research, and accidentally discovered my passion for technology and its impact on people's lives.
Hence, blooms my interest in data analytics, which enables me to understand people in the context of technology.
Currently, I am a Marketing Analyst at a Tech Startup and am looking to grow my technical skills (Python, SQL) for the entire data lifecycle.

## Projects
_*If images don't show up, please read the [GitHub version here](https://github.com/crystalhariga/crystalhariga_portfolio)_

#### 1. [Let's Catch Them Stronger Pokemon!](https://github.com/crystalhariga/pokemon)
* Designed charts visualizing which Pokemon Type is the strongest, you guessed it: it's __Dragon__!
* Built a Logistic Regression Model to determine whether a Pokemon is Legendary for Pokemon Trainers to prevent wastage of Master PokeBalls

<br/>
*Keywords*: Data Visualization, Missing Data, Imbalanced Data, Logistic Regression
*Tools*: Python (pandas, numpy, seaborn, matplotlib, sklearn)

<br/>

#### 2. [Movie Catalog Database Design](https://github.com/crystalhariga/movie-catalog)
* Designed a data dictionary from 4 datasets for ease of accessibility to display movie information onto Movie Catalog web app using Python
* Designed a search algorithm (filtering), by checking whether the search query matches the movie information available (still needs improvement)
* Designed the front-end of web app using Dash: incorporating interactive buttons to search through database, displaying movie information and poster images

<br/>
*Keywords*: Web development, API integration, Search algorithm
*Tools*: Python (pandas, dash, requests, readData)

#### 3. [Predicting Cancer Cases in the US](https://github.com/crystalhariga/cancer_ml)
* Performed data preparation (transformed variables, clustering) and EDA (descriptive statistics, simple visualization) to understand more about the dataset
* Built Prediction (Regression Tree, Linear Regression) and Classification (KNN, Logistic Regression, Boosted Tree, Bagged Tree) models to predict annual cancer cases
* Compared best hand-crafted models with DataRobot's -- resulting in:
    * __Best Classification Model__: Hand-crafted Bagging Tree with 0.93 Accuracy score (_successfully beat DataRobot!_)
    * __Best Prediction Model__: DataRobot's Random Forest Regressor with RMSE of 418.02
