* Performed data preparation on 5 datasets (joining, aggregating, changing data types) using Tableau Prep and R
* Conducted Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to determine impact of COVID on small business owners and identify largest opportunities for upcoming small business owners using R and Tableau
* Recommended upcoming small business owners:
    1. Ideal location: states with lower new COVID case rates (either west coast or central US); lower-income neighborhoods; near parks, transit stations, grocery stores, pharmacies
    2. Ideal industry: transportation supersector, including trade & utilities
    3. Ideal strategy: provide online experiences for customers and alternative options (pick-up, delivery, return, cancellation)
