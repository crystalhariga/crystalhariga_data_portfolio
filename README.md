# Data Analytics Portfolio
This page consists of a comprehensive archive of my data-related projects:
* Data Wrangling
* Data Visualization
* Data Modelling
* And others!


## Data Wrangling
### [P1: Movie Catalog Database design](https://github.com/crystalhariga/movie-catalog) 

## Data Visualization
### [P1: Post-COVID Small Business Launch Recommendation](https://github.com/crystalhariga/data_visualization_consultancy)
* Performed data preparation on 5 datasets (joining, aggregating, changing data types) using Tableau Prep and R
* Conducted Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to determine impact of COVID on small business owners and identify largest opportunities for upcoming small business owners using R and Tableau
* Recommended upcoming small business owners:
    1. Ideal location: states with lower new COVID case rates (either west coast or central US); lower-income neighborhoods; near parks, transit stations, grocery stores, pharmacies
    2. Ideal industry: transportation supersector, including trade & utilities
    3. Ideal strategy: provide online experiences for customers and alternative options (pick-up, delivery, return, cancellation)

## Data Modelling
### [P1: Predicting Cancer Cases in the US](https://github.com/crystalhariga/cancer_ml)
* Performed data preparation (transformed variables, clustering) and EDA (descriptive statistics, simple visualization) to understand more about the dataset
* Built Prediction (Regression Tree, Linear Regression) and Classification (KNN, Logistic Regression, Boosted Tree, Bagged Tree) models to predict annual cancer cases
* Evaluated models above using RMSE, accuracy, confusion matrix, F1 scores to determine best prediction and best classification mode
* Compared best hand-crafted models with DataRobot's -- resulting in:
    * __Best Classification Model__: Hand-crafted Bagging Tree with 0.93 Accuracy score (_successfully beat DataRobot!_)
    * __Best Prediction Model__: DataRobot's Random Forest Regressor with RMSE of 418.02

### [P2: Predicting Customer's Response to a Digital Marketing Campaign](https://github.com/crystalhariga/predictive-modeling_digital-marketing)
